I finally have a basic shell for [my website][1] done. I don't have any real substance up yet. Just a link to the social media, and a link to the blog. Eventually, it'll host my portfolio, a nice, big picture of yours truly, and anything else I see fit to add. It's built on a combination of [Bootstrap][2], [jQuery][3]</a>, and some extra code I had to hack together. That's where you separate the men from the boys. When nothing works, and you're not sure why... It's probably the most frustrating feeling ever. But then eventually you figure it out. Or you just `ctrl + A`, `delete`.

I *did* learn something new tonight though. So normally, an element with `position: absolute;` is no longer effected by `margin: 0 auto;`, which means you can't use that trick to center the element in your page. First, you have set `left: 0;` and `right: 0;`. That allows you to move the "edge" of the element so that `margin: 0 auto;` will work to center it.

Next on the to-do list is set up a portfolio page on the site, and then make things pretty. It's just gross right now. Needs some color. Then I need to get my picture taken. I <em>hate</em> having my picture taken.
