***Week One Day Six***
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/hash-tables-lecture.jpg" height="550px" class="rotate90">

Today we had a lecture about [hash tables][1] from our awesome fellow, Joe. I got to nerd out hard. Data structures are really interesting for me, because I love learning about how the programs and functions are working behind the scenes. Hash tables are especially cool because of the hash function involved. It takes an input, and gives an output which becomes the index. Every time you run the same value through the hash function, it *should* return the same result. But it's not random! It runs bit conversions so that it can assign a value to that specific combination of characters. Amazing.

I also updated the site majorly. Gone is the ugly bootstrap-based page and the WordPress blog. I'm now running the site with [Jekyll][2]. It's a blogging platform that's built for use with [Github Pages][3]. It's pretty cool, because I can also leave WordPress behind. That means I get to write my posts locally and in Markdown. It really just simplifies everything. Take a look at my [Github repo][4] for the site to see more if you're interested. I get to learn a bit of [ruby][5] too.

Lunch is over now, so back to pair programming!
