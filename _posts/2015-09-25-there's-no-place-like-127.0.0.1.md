Today marks one week until my 21st birthday! Woo! I've spent the better part of today so far pushing minor updates to my site, updating my resume, and just getting everything cleaned up. It's proving to be a challenge. Just getting the functionality to be how I want is easy enough, but trying to decide what to include, and what is just unnecessary fluff, is much harder. I feel attached to everything I create, so trimming the fat is tough sometimes.

I always felt strange being the youngest one within my group of friends. In high school, I was the last one to get my license. That wasn't too bad, because I just ended up getting a ride from people. After I left high school and joined the Air Force, it really got frustrating. My friends were all in their mid-/late-twenties. Friday night, and everyone wants to go to the bar? Avi can drive! That always sucked. Nobody really treated me any differently for being younger, but it's just this arbitrary social barrier. There's such a difference in how society views a 20 year old compared to a 21 year old. I'm curious to know why 21 is the magic number, and why the US doesn't follow the lead from the European countries in setting their legal drinking age at 18, or even younger in places.

Also, [Battle for Zendikar][1] comes out on my birthday. Must be a sign.
