I left off [the other day][1] having just left General Assembly. The rest of the journey to MakerSquare is here.

At that point, I knew I had to re-evaluate. I was pretty set on attending General Assembly's program, but that odd experience made me rethink things. I sent an email to the people at MakerSquare to see if I could check out the building and get a few minutes one-on-one to talk about it. They told me they'd love to give me a tour and answer my questions. We arranged to meet up a few days later, and in the meantime, I kept looking into the school some more. I found nothing but high job-placement statistics and rave reviews. It was surprising how good everything looked.

I met with Michael Frank in Santa Monica (when they were still over at Cross Campus), and brought my dad along, as he mentioned that he wanted to ask a few questions for himself. When I walked into the building, it was a totally different experience than at General Assembly. Everyone in the building was focused. People coding, reading, or discussing their projects were everywhere. It was incredible. Michael Frank came down to see me a few minutes later, and showed me around the building. I met a few of the students (One of whom, I get to see again. More about him in another post for another day.), and saw a few projects that they were working on, and I learned a little bit about MakerPrep. It all seemed so amazing. I knew that this was the place for me.

I went home that night, and put in my application to MakerSquare. I had to complete a small coding challenge to gain access to the actual application, which was just a few personal questions about my goals. I got an email back that night, and they told me that if I was interested in MakerPrep, I'd have time to do MakerPrep before the October 5th cohort started. I signed up that night.

MakerPrep is essentially a prep-school for MakerSquare that aims to help people prepare for the technical interview, and for the early weeks of being a MakerSquare student. At the time (I'm not sure if they still do the same, so don't hold me to it), if you passed the interview after finishing MakerPrep, they rolled the cost into the MakerSquare tuition, so it was basically a win-win situation for me, assuming I did well on the interview afterwards.

At that point, I was still a few weeks from starting MakerPrep. I started the [Code Academy][2] track for Javascript, and dusted off my programming knowledge. I anticipated MakerPrep to be mostly review and an exercise in correcting my bad habits, but I wanted to make sure that I was prepared. I spent time on Code Academy, reading [Eloquent Javascript][3], and using [Code Wars][4] to practice. Then in my free time I had to deal with finding a place to live in LA.

There's more to the story, but this is going to have to be enough for now.
