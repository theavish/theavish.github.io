##Kevin - Product Owner
Kevin felt that his experience working on the legacy project was smoother than his experience working on the greenfield project. Admittedly, though, the group decided to keep the scope much smaller on the legacy than on the greenfield. He personally did not run into any real issues. There were fewer conflicts on this than on the previous project. One project management tool that could have been utilized more was Trello. Overall, Kevin is happy with the product that his group made, and he feels that everyone on his team, especially scrum master Tina, did a good job.

##Vidiu - Development Team
Vidiu worked on adding facebook authentication to the find your rooftop app for the legacy project. He feels strongly that the experience was much better on this than on the previous project. He thinks his experience was much improved because he took feedbck his team members gave him after the previous project and implemented it. Part of this feedback was to spend some time becoming familiar with a certain technology or feature before trying to jump right into coding. Following this advice, he was able to learn a lot and overcome challenges he faced along the way to completing his portion of the project. He experienced fewer merge conflicts and felt that communication between his team members was great.

##Matthew - Development Team
Matthew thinks that his group's work on the legacy sprint was successful. He thinks this because the group was very clear about what features it wanted to add or improve prior to undertaking the task and anaged to implement each of said features. While the scope may have been small, this does not diminish the importance of the work that was done. Another important issue to consider is that the group faced two new challenges that it hadn't previously encountered: working remotely; and inheriting and building upon another group's code base. Matt thinks his group successfully managed to deal with both of these challenges.

##Tina - Scrum Master
Tina was the scrum master during the legacy sprint. She thinks the project flow went more smoothly than the greenfield because each team member's role was more clearly established. As the scrum master, she feels she could have checked in with each of the team members more frequently regarding the status of the work they were doing. At the same time, she didn't want to micromanage. On a personal level, she learned a lot by squashing the few merge conflicts that did arise, and she felt that the git workflow was clear. She wishes she had done more coding, but is glad that the group managed to add each of the features it set out to, to ensure that each of those features was functional, and to deploy the application. Considering that the team was on holiday, she feels they did well and were more comfortable and confident throughout the project.

##Avi - Development Team
Avi felt that his team communicated especially well considering that each person was working remotely. Team members were available via Slack whenever another team member had a question. He is happy that the app was deployed. On a final note, he feels that his team did well because the app, with the features that it does have, is fully functional and looks good. While the team added few features, those features work, and the app is now in a better state than it was in when his team received it.
