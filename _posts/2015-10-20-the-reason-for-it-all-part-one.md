A number of people have asked me why I chose [MakerSquare][1]. With all the options out there for coding bootcamps, it's a very valid question. Here in Los Angeles, there's [MakerSquare][1], [General Assembly][2], [Coding Dojo][3], and many others. I'm probably going to split this into two parts so that I'm not writing a giant post when I should be working on classwork instead. I'll go into a little more detail about MakerSquare and General Assembly, as those are the two schools I had an experience with, but I'll post a few links at the end with a list of the rest.

In June this year, I decided it was time for me to go back to school. I'd been out of the Air Force for about nine months at that point, and I was getting tired of just going to work everyday with no mental stimulation. I started taking classes at Grossmont Community College in San Diego to get myself back into the school routine. Everything was going well, but after a few weeks, I realized I just wasn't happy, and I needed more. Some random afternoon of me scrolling through Facebook, I saw an ad in my news feed for General Assembly. It was pretty intriguing, so I did a little research. I discovered that there were many other coding schools in Los Angeles, so I started looking for the best.

The application process for General Assembly was pretty straightforward. They asked for me to answer a few questions about my background, and my reasons for wanting to enter the program. After that, I waited for their response. A couple days later, I had a phone interview with one of the people in their admissions section. He told me more about the program, and the type of things I'd be learning. It all sounded pretty great, so I moved on to the next stage of the admissions process. I had to write a simple 'About Me' page using html, css, and javascript. It took me the better part of the afternoon to have the site built, and I wrote in all my personal information the next day, and sent it off to them.

A week later, I had an in-person interview at the campus in Santa Monica (I don't even remember who it was with, but I believe it was one of the fellows). It was a strange experience when I got to the building. I walked in and saw maybe 15-20 people hanging out and talking. No code being discussed, no studying, no focus. Then I had to wait for almost a half hour until the admissions person came to talk to me, which made me a little upset. We reviewed the page I had written for a few minutes, and I got some good advice about it. We talked about the expectations they had for the students, and the structure of the program. I mentioned that I was also looking at going to MakerSquare. That's when things took a strange turn. "MakerSquare has a fantastic program. You'd love it over there." Interesting. He told me all about MakerSquare and how successful the program there was. I was shocked. Another 20 minutes or so of him telling me about MakerSquare, and I was on my way out.

I don't have as much time to write as I'd originally expected, so the story will have to continue another day.
