##Back-End
###Matthew Murkidjanian
Matt had never used Postgres, and only spent a little bit of time with Bookshelf before working on TasteBuds. He said that in the beginning of the project, he spent the first two days just researching examples of code, schemas, and tutorials to learn as much as he could. He feels that reading documentation helped him learn the most of what he needed to get the work done for the back-end of the project. No matter what struggles the Kickass Koalas were having as a whole, Matthew stayed positive, and tried to learn as much as he could throughout the entire experience. Alongside Tina, he produced the TasteBuds database, and set up the server routes using Express. Matthew feels much more comfortable with using those technologies now, as opposed to how he felt after completing the Node/Express sprints during the junior portion. He wanted to be more involved with the front-end team from the beginning, so that he could help make the connections between server and client happen. Communication was the weak link for the Kickass Koalas.

###Tina Lai
Tina was hazy about working on the back-end of TasteBuds, but she was eager to take on the challenge. Her key to success was breaking down each task into individual steps. She had a solid plan of attack during the whole process, and learned a lot about developing. She liked how well she and Matt worked together, and that they were on the same page during the project. They both spent the first two days reading through documentation so that they would be well prepared before diving into code. Tina felt that the organization and communication within the group was weak, but glad that it all worked out in the end. She felt that it was a great learning experience, and she learned a lot.


##Front-End
###Kevin Cheng
Kevin wants to never have to use git ever again. He had a rough time dealing with merge conflicts, so this is understandable. Kevin saw that the structure of the filesystem for TasteBuds, and felt that it was disorganized and unstructured. He felt that as a team on the front-end, we should have spent more time establishing a set goal to work towards together. We were too segmented in our thinking and planning, so the system broke apart. He thought that we should have taken a day or two to go through some documentation or tutorials on Angular. Kevin learned a lot about Angular and structuring apps for the future. He hopes that his next adventure with Angular goes smoother now that he has had an experience building an app from the ground up.

##Scrum-Master / Front-End
###Vidiu Chiu
Vidiu applauded the back-end team for completing their given tasks before the deadline. He agreed with Matt and Tina's sentiment about constructing a solid foundation before diving into code. Next time, he'll try that approach. He also expressed that the team communication and structure began to fall apart towards the second half of the project. Even though he took on the title of Scrum Master, he was sharing delegation responsibilities with the Product Owner because of his advance knowledge of Angular, however that may have caused some accountability issues because they were both doing the same thing. He acknowledged there were room for improvements and took full responsibility as the Scrum Master. The front-end team chose to work independently on different pages but Vidiu would have preferred to pair program on high priority objectives. He was frustrated with himself because he wanted to do more with the project but at the end of the day it was a great learning experience and he looks forward to working with the team on the Legacy project.


##Product Owner / Front-End
###Avi Samloff
Avi started off with the thought we were going make a grand social service. After a few days, he realized that his original idea was way out of scope for the timeline given. After meeting with Shawn Bullock, he agreed with scaling down. He thought that it was more manageable, and that the project would be fun. The plan was to have the MVP done by Monday, and a presentable product by Tuesday night. Then Sunday night, something was missing across the front-end. TasteBuds' front-end wasn't linking together properly, which broke the app. His original plan for leadership was to allow everyone to work on their own part of the project, and meet up every few hours to check in on ideas and progress. He found that it definitely wasn't enough; working in a group is all about communication. The git issues group-wide may have been semi-allieved with more communication, especially between front-end and back-end. He planned to sit down with back end to make sure everyone was on the same page, and then sit down with the front-end team. The idea was, on a higher level, he could see what everyone was working on, and having issues with. All around, working with the Kickass Koalas was great. Tina did great, and kept trying to force her way in to help the front-end team out. Matt was awesome; the code was beautiful. Vidiu had great overview of the project throughout the project. Kevin had a great work ethic and positivity. As a whole, the whole experience was definitely like a rollercoaster, and it was awesome that the database/front-end communication was fixed literally at the last minute.
