This is the coolest thing. It's a clock with a liquid display. The numbers are created by a substance (I'm not sure what it's made of) that reacts with magnets. The idea behind this, is that because of the flowing nature, you never see the same shape for a number twice. There is something beautiful in that. You'll never see the same point in time twice. I'm amazed by this. Check out the [project page][1] to learn more. I realize that it sounds like I'm promoting the product. I wish I knew the guys who design/developed it. I'd love to pick their brains.

Another day has gone by, and that means we're one day closer to my birthday. I'm so excited to be a real grown up. It's been a long journey. Especially the past year. I got out of the Air Force just over a year ago, and I'm amazed every day what I've learned and experienced since then. You learn a lot about the people you call 'friend' when you're leaving it all behind. Some people just don't care. Others will truly care about you, but those kind souls are few and far between. The genuine ones. That was a tough lesson for me to learn. Only a certain someone remains in my life from those days. I'm glad she stuck with me though.
