>Work smarter, not harder.

In 6th grade, I took a class called Introduction to Technology Fundamentals. The teacher was an old guy named Sam Turner. He seemed to know every answer to every question you could ask. I really looked up to him as a guide and mentor. He was not only my F-block teacher, but he was in charge of the school's TSA team. (I was the guy who won the CO2 Dragster competition at the state level when I was in sixth grade.Â **Nerd.**) Whenever I was having trouble during a phase of my designing or testing, he always had the best nuggets of wisdom to get me over the speed bumps. One weekend, it was 8 or 9 at night, and I was in his classroom with a few others working out the last minute details of our projects. He came to me after noticing I was struggling. "Work smarter, not harder," he told me. That one stuck with me. For years, any time I'm having a difficult time getting through a challenge, I repeat that to myself. To me, it means using the most efficient tools and methods to get a solution. I'm all about efficiency, so that really speaks to me.
