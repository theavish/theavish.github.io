At this point in my MakerSquare career, I've lost track of the days and weeks. It's been a long grind up to this point, and we're still not quite halfway there. Still, I couldn't be happier in my decision to join the third cohort out of Los Angeles. It's been all great times. We finished our last sprint last week. It was a short one about deploying a [bit.ly][1] clone we made to [heroku][2]. Preparing the code for deployment is a moderately annoying process to do manually, so we wrote a Gruntfile to automate a good chunk of the process. However, that wasn't the main thing in my mind. I knew that after the short weekend, it would be time for the MVP project.

The only solo project we do at MakerSquare, the MVP is essentially a two day hackathon. Starting Monday morning, you start writing an app, and you present to the cohort, fellows, and instructors Tuesday after dinner. Monday morning came around, and I was still trying to decide what my app would do. I wanted to make sure that I was using [AngularJS][3] and [Node.js][4], because those are two frameworks that I am very interested in working with in the future.

My first app idea was for a chrome extension that would highlight the name of any Magic the Gathering card whose name appears in a webpage. It would have a popup with the card image when the user moused over the card name, and give them a link to purchase the card online. After looking into the amount of work involved, I decided it was a little out of scope for the project. I would have had to spend all of my time writing an algorithm that would parse through the page contents looking for the card names. It's still something I'm interested in doing, but it'll have to wait for another time.

My next idea came to me while I was shuffling through Spotify for music. A [corny country song][5] by Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffet came through my headphones when I thought, "I wish I knew where it was five," and the light bulb went on. Thanks to a strange playlist on Spotify, [fiveOC][6] was born.

[fiveOC][6] is a simple app that takes the user's location and time, and shows somewhere in the world where it's five o'clock. It was made using Angular, Node, Express, jQuery, and a little bit of frustration. I decided to host on firebase, simply because I find the interface and setup to be incredibly easy to use. I'm all about minimalism and simplicity. [Check out the code on github][7] if you're not afraid of ugly code. That's definitely something I need to work on more. I hear pretty often that good comments in code are a good habit to form, so it's one that I plan on forcing on myself going into the future.
