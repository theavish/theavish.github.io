Hello, World. My name is Avi, and I’m a programmer. At least I’m trying to be, anyway. I tell people I’m from San Diego, but I went to high school in Virginia, and that’s arguably the most defining years of a young teen’s life. So I guess I’m from San Diego, but I grew up in Richmond.

I’m going to school in Santa Monica at [MakerSquare][1]. I’ve been into computers and programming for several years, but I’m just now starting to be formal in my education about it. I taught myself html and css when I was in middle school, and I’ve been in love ever since. I’m pretty stoked to continue down the rabbit hole into Javascript.

In future posts, you can be sure to learn more about my daily struggles of life, my rambling about code I’m working on, and my love/hate relationship with [Magic: The Gathering][2].

More from me later.
